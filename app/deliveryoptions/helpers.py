"""
Helper functions module for the Django app.
Contains functions to replace template placeholders with dynamic content.
These functions are used in the delivery_option_tagsdictionary.

NOTE:
The helper functions all have either 0, 1 or 2 parameters in their signature.
Some include a parameter called 'record', some include a parameter called 'api_surrogate_list'
and some have both or neither.
These functions are all called generically from html_replacer().
As more information is made available from Rosetta, (or elsewhere), we may need to add one or
other of these parameters to some of the helper functions. All that needs to be done is to add
'record: Record' and/or 'api_surrogate_list: List' to the parameter list (as required) and the
generic function will automatically handle it.
